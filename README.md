# Bookmark-Extension
I have created a bookmark extension for chrome from scratch. It works and its cool.

1) CLick "Save Tab" to save to bookmark the link of current tab which you are viewing.
2) Click "Save Input" after you copy-paste or type the link in input box.
3) Double Click "Delete All" to delete all the saved links.
